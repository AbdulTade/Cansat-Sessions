# Seesion-2

* On account of the problems during our last meeting, We will review the C programming langauge very briefly.
* We will start from basic datatypes to advanced constructs like pointers etc.
* We will also review a tiny bit of the c-library functions
* I will give a classwork for everyone to try.
